# BFS-Maze-Solver

BFS-Maze-Solver is a Python script that uses Computer Vision and Data Structures & Algorithms to trace a solution path in a maze.

The idea is to treat every pixel as a node of a graph and the surrounding pixels as connected nodes. Now with the help of OpenCv library a BFS traversal is performed to reach the destination point and to create a path.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following.

```bash
pip install cv2
pip install threading
```

## Usage
Run the script:  ``` maze.py```

Click once to select the starting point

Click again to select the destination point
